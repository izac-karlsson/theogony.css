#### Accordion

Accordions are interactable containers which content may not be of the greatest importance or as blocks of navigation.

    <div class="accordion">
        <!--
            ...
        -->
    </div>

&nbsp;
#### Card

Cards are usually static containers that are used to display smaller amounts of content.

    <div class="card">
        <!--
            ...
        -->
    </div>

&nbsp;
#### Carousel

Carousels are another form of an interactable container that's helpful when there's a lot of content but a lack of available space.

    <nav class="carousel">
        <!--
            ...
        -->
    </nav>
